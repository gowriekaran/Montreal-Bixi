# montreal-bixi
Just a mini project that simply processes the open data JSON file https://secure.bixi.com/data/stations.json provided by Montreal Bixi, and appends it into Google maps using a user friendly format.

You can check it out live here: https://www.gowriekaran.com/montreal-bixi/

Since the Google maps API is no longer free, please expect limited functionality.

Also, It's unlikely that I will ever update this app again.
